 * variables captured by the function body and serializes those values into the generated text along with the function
 * body.  This process is recursive, so that functions referenced by the body of the serialized function will themselves
 * be serialized as well.  This process also deeply serializes captured object values, including prototype chains and
 * property descriptors, such that the semantics of the function when deserialized should match the original function.
 *
 * There are several known limitations:
 * - If a native function is captured either directly or indirectly, closure serialization will return an error.
 * - Captured values will be serialized based on their values at the time that `serializeFunction` is called.  Mutations
 *   to these values after that (but before the deserialized function is used) will not be observed by the deserialized
 *   function.
 *
 * @param func The JavaScript function to serialize.
 * @param args Arguments to use to control the serialization of the JavaScript function.

/**
 * Job represents the configuration of a single job.
 *
 * This resource waits until its status is ready before registering success
 * for create/update, and populating output properties from the current state of the resource.
 * The following conditions are used to determine whether the resource creation has
 * succeeded or failed:
 *
 * 1. The Job's '.status.startTime' is set, which indicates that the Job has started running.
 * 2. The Job's '.status.conditions' has a status of type 'Complete', and a 'status' set
 *    to 'True'.
 * 3. The Job's '.status.conditions' do not have a status of type 'Failed', with a
 *     'status' set to 'True'. If this condition is set, we should fail the Job immediately.
 *
 * If the Job has not reached a Ready state after 10 minutes, it will
 * time out and mark the resource update as Failed. You can override the default timeout value
 * by setting the 'customTimeouts' option on the resource.
 *
 * By default, if a resource failed to become ready in a previous update,
 * Pulumi will continue to wait for readiness on the next update. If you would prefer
 * to schedule a replacement for an unready resource on the next update, you can add the
 * "pulumi.com/replaceUnready": "true" annotation to the resource definition.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Create a Job with auto-naming
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as kubernetes from "@pulumi/kubernetes";
 *
 * const job = new kubernetes.batch.v1.Job("pi", {
 *     spec: {
 *         template: {
 *             spec: {
 *                 containers: [{
 *                     name: "pi",
 *                     image: "perl",
 *                     command: [
 *                         "perl",
 *                         "-Mbignum=bpi",
 *                         "-wle",
 *                         "print bpi(2000)",
 *                     ],
 *                 }],
 *                 restartPolicy: "Never",
 *             },
 *         },
 *         backoffLimit: 4,
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Create a Job with a user-specified name
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as kubernetes from "@pulumi/kubernetes";
 *
 * const job = new kubernetes.batch.v1.Job("pi", {
 *     metadata: {
 *         name: "pi",
 *     },
 *     spec: {
 *         template: {
 *             spec: {
 *                 containers: [{
 *                     name: "pi",
 *                     image: "perl",
 *                     command: [
 *                         "perl",
 *                         "-Mbignum=bpi",
 *                         "-wle",
 *                         "print bpi(2000)",
 *                     ],
 *                 }],
 *                 restartPolicy: "Never",
 *             },
 *         },
 *         backoffLimit: 4,
 *     },
 * });
 * ```

:doctitle:  Kong on Kubernetes with Pulumi

== About
=== Why?
The quest for resilience and agility has driven us into the modern age of micro-services. Bringing services to market on a micro service architecture demands utilization of sprawling technology offerings and tooling. Universally this journey includes an infrastructure orchestration phase, an application deployment phase, and a service publishing phase.

In this hands on series we will dive into using both Kong API Gateway for service publishing, and Pulumi to orchestrate our infrastructure, deploy our applications, and configure kong.

=== Tools

*Kong Gateway* is an API gateway and Ingress Controller. An API gateway is a reverse proxy that allows an organization to offer APIs as a product to internal and external clients via a centralized ingress point. An API gateway shows itâ€™s true value when leveraged to consolidate capabilities such as authentication, session handling, rate limiting, traffic monitoring, and logging. These advanced routing features offload enforcement, maintenance, and visibility from the application teams improving their agility and consolidates this functional ownership into a central location improving global consistency and visibility.

*Pulumi* is a cloud engineering platform that brings infrastructure teams, developers, and security teams together through a unified software engineering process that accelerates innovation. The Pulumi platform and SDKs allow teams to build, deploy, and manage modern cloud applications faster and with more confidence, using any language, any architecture and any cloud. Supporting Modern Infrastructure as Code using popular programming languages including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go and .NET/C#.
